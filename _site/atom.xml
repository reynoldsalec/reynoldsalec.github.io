  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Unite all the nodes!</p>

<p>Linode provides inexpensive, reliable servers. If you want to &ldquo;set and forget&rdquo;
a Node app (or multiple apps), Linode can be a good option. Although I&rsquo;ve since
started using Docker Cloud for most of my microservice hosting needs, here&rsquo;s
how I used to run Kalabox.io, the Kalabox API documentation, and our system
dashboard on Linode:</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>1. Upload your Node app to your desired webroot on Linode</p>

<pre><code>scp -r yourstuff user@IP:/path/to/webroot
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this assumes you either have your SSH key setup on your Linode server
OR that you have your user&rsquo;s credentials handy.</p>

<p>2. Install Node on linode</p>

<pre><code>cd ~
wget [LATEST TAR FOR LINUX]
mkdir node
tar xvf node-v*.tar.?z --strip-components=1 -C ./node

# Remove cruft and create node directory in our home directory
cd ~
rm -rf node-v*
mkdir node/etc

# Link up npm to installed node packages
echo 'prefix=/usr/local' &gt; node/etc/npmrc

# Get your node executable alongside other binaries
sudo mv node /opt/
sudo chown -R root: /opt/node

# Get your node executable into path
sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node
sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/npm /usr/local/bin/npm
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>node -v</code> runs, we&rsquo;re good!</p>

<p>3. Use PM2 to keep the node process STAYIN' ALIVE</p>

<p>  In the case that our Node app goes down for some reason or our server is
  restarted, we want to make sure our application is restarted automatically!
  Fortunately, a tool called pm2 (process manager) makes this easy:</p>

<pre><code class="``">  sudo npm install pm2 -g

  #Have PM2 start things up and keep it up:
  pm2 start server.js

  #Run PM2 on server start so you don't have to do it manually on restarts:
  pm2 startup debian

  #Note you'll need to put your Linux distro in here. It should output a command that you'll run with root permissions:
</code></pre>

<h2>Advantages/Disadvantages</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to have a handful of Node apps running for a long time without
many (if any) changes, doing this setup once is probably a good solution.</p>

<p>However, if you&rsquo;ll be making frequent changes, have a need to scale your apps
quickly, or are introducing complicated dependencies, I highly recommend
hosting your Node apps using Docker and a Docker &ldquo;Infrastructure as a Service&rdquo;
(IaaS) provider like Docker Cloud. It may cost more initially and introduce
further complexity, but the dividends are great.</p>

<p>Stay frosty friends!</p>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Kids make great materialists. Remember when you knew <em>exactly</em> what you wanted for Christmas, and you had a bunch of adults waiting to fight through inclement weather and incite shopping mall riots just to obtain it for you?</p>

<p>Perhaps you weren&rsquo;t as spoiled rotten as me, but I&rsquo;m sure most working folk can commiserate that it&rsquo;s often hard enough to find time to think of presents for your loved ones, let alone yourself. To remedy this situation, I&rsquo;m publishing some of the items that I&rsquo;m sending out to my family, along with some of the stuff that I&rsquo;m considering getting for them. And if you have a bad materialist in your life who&rsquo;s been working rather than writing their wishlist, perhaps you can find something here for them as well.</p>

<p>Warning: this is basically a Christmas list.</p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<h3>Music</h3>

<p>Soulection, a label based out of Los Angeles, is one of my favorite listens right now. They provide a mashup of hip hop, R&amp;B, jazz, and other stylings to create a very organic, soulful mix of artists and sounds. Great stuff for a rainy day or relaxed evening. Conscious music for conscious minds. These two records are missing from my current catalogue:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://store.soulection.com/product/evil-needle-sivey-ep-vinyl">Constructive Interference EP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://soulection.com/s030-dpat-in-bloom">In Bloom LP</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Vinyl Stuffs</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m one of those vinyl guys, mostly because I like the big album art and the interactivity of flipping a record. Funny how something that was a pain-in-the-neck before digital music has now become a selling point&hellip;</p>

<p>In any case, I&rsquo;m missing some essentials to keep my records sounding sharp and for adjusting my player. A couple welcome additions to the crowd:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/AudioQuest-LP-record-clean-brush/dp/B0006VMBHI/ref=pd_sim_e_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1ZSKVMKG4P9YFNSNVGNX">Record Cleaning Brush</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/SPIN-CLEAN-STARTER-RECORD-WASHER-SYSTEM/dp/B002UKSZUU/ref=pd_sim_e_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1ZSKVMKG4P9YFNSNVGNX">Record Washer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shure-SFG-2-Stylus-Tracking-Force/dp/B00006I5SD">Stylus Tracker</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>My Significant Other</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahbranon">@sarahbranon</a>, issue a pull request to add/remove items :)</p>

<h3>Bike Stuff</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a dark, rainy time of year, so some extra bike gear is always a great way of saying &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; by lighting your loved-one&rsquo;s bike up like the UFO in Close Encounters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cool lights for bike wheels</li>
<li>Bike Pannier</li>
</ul>


<h3>Kitchen-y Things</h3>

<p>Ah the kitchen: domestic so it&rsquo;s warm and personal, but public so you can borrow these items for your own use as well. Score!</p>

<ul>
<li>Reusable coffee cup</li>
<li>Fancy cocktail things (like essence of orange, bitters&hellip;you know, the things that come in little bottles)</li>
<li>Copper mug</li>
<li>Tea ball</li>
<li>Fancy cooking food (other than olive oil/vinegar, Sarah&rsquo;s mom has that locked DOWN)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Clothes</h3>

<p>Fitted clothes probably aren&rsquo;t a great bet; if you go that route, a receipt&rsquo;s always a good idea.
- Scarves
- Running beanie (not a cute fluffy beanie, a serious beanie)
- Duffel bag (because she keeps stealing mine)</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nice smelling soaps</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VGN75U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Klipsch Headphones</a></li>
<li>Charity donations</li>
</ul>

  <updated>2014-11-10T13:00:00Z</updated>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h2>Friday: Front-end Summit</h2>

<p>This summit had a couch on the stage. Already a different tone set. Some cool things I learned:</p>

<h3><a name="quail">Quail: Accessibility Testing</a></h3>

<p>As speaker so elequontly put, &ldquo;we are all temporarily abled&rdquo;: everyone will have to deal with some variety of disability, and as I squinted to see all the way to the stage (damn computer monitor eyes!), it was easy for me to remember the importance of web accessibility.</p>

<p>Quail is a jQuery plugin that helps make sure that accessbility standards (like the 50+ in WCAG 2.0) are fulfilled. For Drupal users, it&rsquo;s integrated into the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/accessibility">Accessibility</a> module. Although the speaker noted that Quail isn&rsquo;t quite production ready, it&rsquo;s a great starting point. Former Kalamunoid Steven Bassett made a very good comment that the verbosity of Quail means it can often encourage excessivly slavish accessibility implementations that can confuse people using screenreaders and others with reading disabilities.</p>

<h3><a name="justafish">@justafish: Views, drupal_add_js, and other things that annoy her</a></h3>

<p>hook_page_build() and the #attached attribute instead of drupal_add_js so you won&rsquo;t have JS added to non-HTML requests. I&rsquo;m kind of curious about this, particularly considering drupal_add_js <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21includes%21common.inc/function/_drupal_add_js/8">is being deprecated</a> in Drupal 8.</p>

<p>She dislikes Views: writes custom code using Entity Field Queries to grab the entities you want to display, and then renders using Entity View Modes. HERESY! But very efficient heresy that doesn&rsquo;t leave a bunch of Features-generated code cruft that&rsquo;s impossible to QA in a diff. If you must use Views, justafish recommends using Entity View Modes to generate the individual pieces.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>Sadly less sessions were visited on Saturday.</p>

<h3><a name="drupal-commerce">@ryanszrama Drupal Commerce in Drupal 8</a></h3>

<p>Ryan is surprised at how many people have actually launched sites on <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart">Commerce Kickstart</a>, the demo framework for Drupal Commerce. What was intended a demo has become a viable out-of-the-box solution for a small- to medium-sized online merchant. Winning combo of streamlined admin, responsive theme, content-rich product catalogue with zooms, slideshows, and other effects to highlight merchandise, faceted product search, and integrated payment gateways.</p>

<p>Drupal Commerce 2.0 wants to take some of the functionality from Kickstart and integrate it into core Commerce. The Commerce team started from scratch. Some big differences and improvements include&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved data model that moves from basic 5 entity types (product/order/line item/customer profile/payment transaction) to nine, adding a store model, invoice, and payment allocation models. These should allow for better handling of complex business logic like refunds and handling of multi-store/multi-vendor setups.</li>
<li>A hierarchical product model for handling variations on products. For example, different colors/sizes of shirts should inherit attributes from the parent shirt product.</li>
<li>Flexible workflows for &ldquo;order status&rdquo;: imagine if you could define a mandatory workflow for different types of orders that it must go through a flow of order statuses with permissioning and actions required to move the order status.</li>
<li>Discount handling in core.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ryan views stand-alone PHP libraries that tackle universal commerce problems, like tax management, address management, currency handling, etc. as being valuable contributions from the Commerce project to the greater PHP ecosystem. Some libraries include&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/commerceguys/intl">Internationalization</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing">Addressing</a>: Uses a Google dataset to build dynamic address forms appropriate to different regions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/commerceguys/pricing">Pricing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/commerceguys/zone">Zone</a>: International taxation zones.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/commerceguys/tax">Tax</a>: International taxation zones.</li>
</ul>


<p>Commerce Guys hopes to maintain single libraries for these core commerce problems that MANY PHP commerce projects can use; already Symfony folks are contributing to these libraries. Drupal 7 may even benefit from the Addressing library in a backport.</p>

<h2>MORE NOTES TO FOLLOW.</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m traveling summit to summit, session to session, and will be updating this throughout the camp!</p>

  <title type="text">Businesses on the VERGE of Sustainability</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://reynoldsalec.github.io/2014/10/verge-tourist/" />
  <id>http://reynoldsalec.github.io/2014/10/verge-tourist</id>
  <published>2014-10-29T14:00:00Z</published>
  <updated>2014-10-29T14:00:00Z</updated>
  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Sustainability remains a potentially loaded term in some circles. Some managers or clients remain nervous about considering the idea of a triple (financial/social/environmental) bottom line: one line will do for them nicely, thank you very much.</p>

<p>However, sustainable business has undergone a revolution over the last 10 years, and after my discussions at VERGE, a conference put on by the lovely people over at GreenBiz to bring together people interested in sustainable business and policy, I came away with the undeniable impression that businesses are investing in sustainable strategy with unprecedented vigour. Here are a couple reasons we all should be attending more sustainable business conferences.</p>

<h2>Reason 1: You&rsquo;re Invited to the Party</h2>

<p>Concerned that your business isn&rsquo;t working towards a more sustainable future? I was too, despite my history as an assiduous recycler.</p>

<p>Kalamuna provides its web development and strategy services for a wide range of clients. Although we&rsquo;re not helping Chevron redesign its site, most of these clients aren&rsquo;t folks who are creating a cleaner combustion engine or helping design longer-lasting buildings (although our clients Pinnacle Engines and Computer Structures Inc. are doing just that).</p>

<blockquote><p>People come from so many different backgrounds that it’s ok not being an expert at most (or any) of the conference topics</p></blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, people come from so many different backgrounds that it&rsquo;s ok not being an expert at most (or any) of the conference topics. A cross-section of the attendees I met included&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>MBAs and other graduate students looking for job opportunities</li>
<li>Owners of businesses who specialize in clean energy, data collection/analysis, facilities management, supply chain analysis, insurance&hellip;you name it</li>
<li>Dyed-in-the-wool academics</li>
<li>Non-profit sector movers-and-shakers</li>
<li>Government people</li>
<li>Consultants of every guild, creed and persuasion</li>
<li>People who managed to trick their finance officer into paying for a ticket</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s a very diverse event, more so than the technology conferences I&rsquo;m accustom to, which normally have a homogenous crowd of technology providers/vendors clustered around the event topic. Just make sure you come ready to fill up your noggin with a new vocabulary and mental map.</p>

<h2>Reason 2: You Can Start Participating Now</h2>

<p>Technology is fun because almost anyone with access to a computer, intelligence, and drive can pick-up the essentials to start a new business with little capital. The demand for technology services is so high, it&rsquo;s typically easy to find those first clients.</p>

<p>I think this is less true for many of the businesses I spoke to at VERGE. After-all, it&rsquo;s hard to create a sustainable power company without a substantial investment in education about electrical engineering, knowledge of utility policies, and access to a reasonable amount of capital for equipment.</p>

<p>However, many of these services are so new, if you have modicum of experience you can easily become a competitor. At VERGE, I met quite a few people who were leveraging the fast-growing demand for sustainable services and consulting to grow businesses or find a new career without making huge investments or taking unwarranted risks.</p>

<blockquote><p>I met quite a few people who were leveraging the fast-growing demand for sustainable services and consulting to grow businesses or find a new career</p></blockquote>

<p>One gentleman I met had a high school degree and 5 years of tinkering on natural gas engines; this made him a lead engineer at a leading maker of bio-fuel generators. Another woman years experience as a project manager, some time behind the wheel as a Lyft driver, and the insight that low-income communities are being excluded from new transportation solutions like Lyft and Uber. This makes her a contender in the ridesharing space to create new solutions for this underserved market. Exploration of what sustainability means and how to achieve it is nascent. Despite heavy investment by some large companies, there&rsquo;s plenty of real estate left for you to establish a presence and create new solutions in.</p>

<h2>Reason 3: You Want to Solve Big Problems, Right?</h2>

<p>We all do it. Corralled in our industries, our focus is often on the day-to-day. Making sure employees are tracking time correctly, taking care of something for a client, putting receipts in a shoebox to ward away auditors: these are the problems we solve.</p>

<p>If you read the news, you probably feel like solving these immediate day-to-day issues is having little impact on the world&rsquo;s greater problems. Hunger. Inequality. Disease. People generally being shitty to each other and not having a good time here on planet Earth. What progress are we making against these planetary El Guapos in our own businesses?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/elguapo.jpg" alt="Our El Guapo is a Plethora of Global Maladies" /></p>

<p>VERGE was chock-full of people helping solve these problems, many of them doing so not only for societal good but for a profit as well. The day-to-day issues never go away, but wouldn&rsquo;t you rather solve HR issues while also creating power from grape pomace?</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For roughly a year my colleagues and I have been working with the Greener Media Group, the promoters of VERGE, on their main web property.  Earlier this week my colleagues and I at Kalamuna were proud to launch <a href="http://greenbiz.com">greenbiz.com</a>. A huge thanks and congratulations goes out to my partner Andrew Mallis, who headed the project and our partners at Greenbiz, Hugh Byrne and Krys Freeman. I came to technology to solve problems, I&rsquo;ve stayed because I like the people I solve problems for.</p>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It&rsquo;s amazing to some of us in the software engineering trade, but outside our perfect world of relational, non-relational, and completely anti-social databases (I&rsquo;ve met a few old MSSQL databases that WILL bite), the rest of humanity persists in thinking that the spreadsheet is a useful way of structuring data.</p>

<p>Case in point: tonight I had the privilige of watching Simon Rogers, a pioneering &ldquo;data journalist&rdquo;, who came to prominence divining stories out of data for the Guardian and now makes his living at the Ur-source of data, Twitter. Throughout his presentation, he showed delightfully simple yet powerful and dynamic presentations of data. It was the kind of presentation that illicits audible &ldquo;ooos&rdquo; and &ldquo;awws&rdquo; from the audience, a great demonstration of the story-telling power of what was formerly just associated sets of numbers, text, and geolocation data. Here&rsquo;s Simon&rsquo;s process:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/guardian-data-workflow-001.jpg" alt="The Guardian's Data Workflow" /></p>

<p>Notice step 2, &ldquo;Spreadsheet&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s where the action happens, where everything comes together. In the aftermath of the London riots, Simon helped the Guardian collect data from metropolitan courts. At first, the courts refused to release the data, but after an edict from the national government, complied with reems of data in physical documents, PDFs, cuneiform tablets, etc. How did the Guardian team turn this into data? In Simon&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;in the age old method of bringing in interns&rdquo; to move all the data into spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Interns. And. Spreadsheets. This is something everyone who has worked in an office for the last twenty years can understand, but a fact that consultants like myself can easily forget. We view the CSV as an &ldquo;export&rdquo;, something to be quickly discarded as a secondary product of our perfect data systems, the offal of our CMS. However, for most the world, this is the most accessible format for editing and organizing data.</p>

<p>Why this discrepancy? For many technical advisors, we have a bias against human sorted data. We&rsquo;ve seen too many spreadsheets filled with values that could easily be standardized (&ldquo;US&rdquo;. United States". &ldquo;United States   &rdquo;.). We hate how long it takes to load and parse them. We want complex relationships that are not as easily represented.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to discard (some of) this wariness in favor of a more pragmatic view. For small and even medium-sized software projects, many users can be well-served by a simple spreadsheet. Many of us need to look at Google Forms as a model for usability and accessbility, lest we fall into a trap of premature optimization. Some thoughts from around the web to meditate on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://davidmichaelross.com/blog/microsoft-excel-is-everywhere">Sorry, Geeks, Microsoft Excel is Everywhere</a>: Good brief history of spreadsheets, making the valid point that spreadsheets are basically &ldquo;Regular people using computers&hellip;sorta-kinda programming!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freeagent.com/central/spreadsheet-debate-why-i-hate-spreadsheets">The Great Spreadsheet Debate: Why I Hate Spreadsheets</a>: This is where all us technical folks are coming from. Sidenote, apparently this spreadsheet battle is something that FreeAgent is capitalizing on. I suspect this debate has probably been around since Lotus 123, which probably makes it older than I am.</li>
</ul>
