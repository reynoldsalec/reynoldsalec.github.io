========================

The website of Alec Reynolds, an entrepreneur and developer from Oakland, CA.

The basis for this website was liberally borrowed from the [codebase](https://github.com/davidensinger/davidensinger.github.io) of [David Ensinger](http://davidensinger.com/), a Front End Developer from Columbus, OH. Big thanks to David and an invitation to all who are interested in using this Jekyll-powered site as a beginning for their own project.
