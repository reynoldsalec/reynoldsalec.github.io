## Rules in Play

As the founder of a company that centers itself on the concept of "play", I often find it difficult to foster an environment of creative exploration in a professional environment that is continuously demanding better products within shorter timelines and tighter budgets. It's equally difficult to tell a team member that their mind-blowing concept exceeds scope as it is to tell a client that their budget has been blown.

To prevent these uncomfortable conversations and to preserve play, rules are necessary. Indeed, rules often determine the success of play; games with bad rules aren't fun, and web projects without guidelines can fall into dissarray. However, the wrong set of rules can stiffle play.

### How to Hypnotize a Chicken

Children are geniuses at play. At a certain age (parents will probably claim All ages), kids are programmed to explore the world around them, pushing the boundaries of gravity, their parent's will, and general human decency to figure out exactly how our messy world functions.

While munching on some toast one Saturday morning, I mentioned to my neighbor's first-grade daughter that chickens could be hypnotized by drawing a straight line on the ground in front of them. This shocking revelation demanded investigation. I was summarily drafted to be a labratory assistant in a great chicken hypnotizing experiment.

After traumatizing the entire flock of hens, my young scientist had investigated some of the great questions of our age: What kind of lines hypnotize best? (straight) Did we need better chalk? (heavy white chalk is ideal) Are black chickens more or less susceptible to hypnotism than brown ones? (inconclusive)

### Implicit Rules are Best
While she ran about the yard corralling a few more test subjects, I started thinking about what I had seen. Afterall, this kinetic combination of problem-solving with dynamic motion was the essence of play, an exemplar not too far removed from the best team interactions I've seen at Kalamuna.

One of the things that immediately struck me was how chaotic play is. In catching a chicken, a child quibles not with fears of hurting or upsetting the bird; her focus is on capturing a test subject, and to do so she's willing to yank a few tail feathers and bend a wing or two. Although at first alarmed and offering some largely ineffectual advice ("Becareful with )
