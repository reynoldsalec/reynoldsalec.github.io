Greetings friend! My name is __Alec Reynolds__, an entrepreneurial developer who currently makes his dough as a co-founder at __[Kalamuna](http://www.kalamuna.com)__. I'm interested in finding ways that people can live better as individuals, together in society.

Right now I try to give back to the world by providing more and more value to my customers, who are mostly higher-education institutions like UC Berkeley, mission-driven businesses like Greenbiz, and non-profits like California's Valued Trust. In the future, I'm interested in translating the good work I do into capital "g" Good in technology, sustainability, and beyond.

To achieve that objective, I founded Kalamuna with three of my trusted colleagues. Together we shared a dream of using the lessons we learn daily making websites for our clients to create __products__. Products are tools that allow us, a small group of talented people, to provide exponentially more Good to our community than we could as individuals limited to our finite waking hours and pools of energy.

When I'm not at the desk, I'm usually training for a marathon, learning more about Tiki history via a Mai Tai, and talking to folks at local community events.
