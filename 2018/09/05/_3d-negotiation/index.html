The thought of bartering over anything, from a salary to your kid's Minecraft time can be nerve-wracking. No matter how much you rehearse your arguments, you always have the sick feeling that you're getting the short end of the deal.</p> <p>As web developers and project managers, we often chose our career precisely <em>because</em> it doesn't involve negotiating. You can't convince broken code to fix itself, no matter how hard you might scream and cry when fixing a bug in the dead of night. Our jobs are about finding creative solutions to problems. Leave negotiation to the sales team, and let us get to the real work.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this perspective leads to our biggest problems. There are only so many times you can see an overly aggressive timeline transform into technical debt, or watch requirements pile up on development teams with limited resources.</p> <p>We'd love to blame smooth-talking VPs and powerful C-levels, but ultimately all of these workplace dialogues, from project timelines, feature requests, hiring decisions, and more are two-way negotiations. Far from being powerless, we're uniquely powerful. We know the most about what's possible, what's needed to get the job done well, impacts on revenue, and other facts. With the proper guidance, we can negotiate better outcomes, making us more successful, less stressed, and more satisfied.</p> <p>Unfortunately, most of us relinquish this unique power by adopting one of two tactics. In the first negotiating anti-pattern, &quot;Yes to Impress&quot;, we bypass negotiation by saying &quot;yes&quot; in all scenarios. This is common to younger PMs and devs. Many mature web professionals fall into the second anti-pattern, the &quot;Party of No&quot;. Jaded by burn-out and the failures of grandiose plans, these project managers and web developers are constantly digging in their heels, creating boundaries, and trying to maintain a status quo that they believe will protect their personal time.</p> <h2 id="yes-to-impress"><a href="#yes-to-impress" class="header-anchor">#</a> Yes to Impress</h2> <p>&quot;No problem, it's easy, will just take a few minutes!&quot; says your colleague with the raccoon eyes and the suspiciously full cup of coffee. It's 5PM, you're leaving the office, and they've just accepted another project. Everyone on the team marvels over their capacity for work, but they're too busy to learn new skills and seem to be on their way to a heart attack.</p> <p>Saying yes can be the path of least resistance, but it has obvious taxes on our personal lives and insidious costs in our professional ones. Unchecked, we ratchet up expectations to an unsustainable level where we are destined to underdeliver on artificially high expectations. Most young developers start out as &quot;Yes to Impress&quot; people. But as time continues, they become card carrying members of the &quot;Party of No&quot;.</p> <h2 id="party-of-no"><a href="#party-of-no" class="header-anchor">#</a> Party of No</h2> <p>&quot;I know this is a small change, but if we do this one, they'll ask for a bunch more. Not on my watch!&quot; says your teammate. It's the 3rd time they've tried pushing back on a text change from marketing. Today. It's a spelling correction.</p> <p>&quot;No&quot; is a powerful word, and creating boundaries is smart in any situation. However, if we use &quot;no&quot; indiscriminately, we ignore the value that can come from engaging with our co-workers. Consistently rejecting new projects, ideas, or calls for change reduces our standing in the team and inhibits our professional growth. We may be able to safeguard our personal time, but at what cost? Disengagement from work can make our lives less fulfilling overall, and ultimately puts us at risk of obsolescence.</p> <h2 id="why-do-we-give-away-our-negotiating-power"><a href="#why-do-we-give-away-our-negotiating-power" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why Do We Give Away Our Negotiating Power?</h2> <p>Both the &quot;Yes to Impress&quot; and &quot;Party of No&quot; tactics are easy to fall into because they are easy. Negotiation is hard, particularly with the people who hired (and could fire) us. If you're a &quot;Yes to Impress&quot; person, you'll be afraid of being too disagreeable. If you're a &quot;Party of No&quot; member, you likely doubt better project outcomes are possible.</p> <p>Fundamentally, we doubt our power to create change. If the sales team has created a new contract structure that will require a complete rewrite of the billing system (an annual tradition that threatens to become biannual), what can we really do to change the plan?</p> <h2 id="_1-ask-lots-of-questions"><a href="#_1-ask-lots-of-questions" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. Ask Lots of Questions</h2> <p>Start by understanding the players. Why is sales always changing contracts and making &quot;innovative&quot; pricing? Perhaps it has something to do with the frequent changeover in sales staff. Maybe it's related to the CEO's new company direction. Are the costs of making this upgrade clear to all stakeholders? Who can you talk to that understands these issues?</p> <h2 id="_2-love-hearing-no"><a href="#_2-love-hearing-no" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Love Hearing &quot;No&quot;</h2> <p>When you start proposing alternatives or making comments, expect and embrace &quot;no&quot;. When someone tells you no, you've found some sort of limit. Figure out what it is. Most limits are not hard and can be overcome by asking more &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what&quot; questions that are targeted towards</p> <h2 id="_3-embrace-your-power-to-negotiate"><a href="#_3-embrace-your-power-to-negotiate" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Embrace Your Power to Negotiate</h2> <p>You are not small. Remember that developers, PMs, designers, and other &quot;technical&quot;, &quot;creative-minded&quot; people found many of our most successful companies. Do you think the AirBnB guys started out as great negotiators? Hell no! As broke designers maxing out credit cards to fund their startup, their most successful negotiating tactic was to leave Paul Graham a box of breakfast cereal to get admission into Y Combinator. But with the right instruction, they were able to take a failing business concept and turn it into an industry-disrupting powerhouse.</p> <p>Here are a few books that have helped change my perception of &quot;negotiation&quot; from a dirty word to an integral part of my daily life:</p> <ul><li>Never Split the Difference</li> <li>3D Negotiation</li></ul> <p>Your salary? The contract price for a project with a client or vendor? Have you haggled with your tween over their computer time or bartered with</p> <p>Negotiation permeates</p> <p>Developers are good &quot;value creators:&quot; we want to make the pie bigger for everyone through creative solutions. However, we tend to be put-off by &quot;value claimers,&quot; the people who say &quot;no&quot; and often dominate negotiations by intimidating the other party into concessions.</p> <h2 id="three-dimensional-negotiation"><a href="#three-dimensional-negotiation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Three Dimensional Negotiation</h2> <p>In their book &quot;3D Negotiation&quot;, David Lax and James K. Sebenius describe three dimensions to every negotation. Yes, there is the aspect of &quot;at the table&quot; tactics, but beyond this &quot;stare 'em in the eye&quot; style of negotiation, there are two other dimensions that use the type of creative, solutions-focused thinking that technical thinkers excel at.</p> <h3 id="deal-design"><a href="#deal-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> Deal Design:</h3> <p>Good deal design sees us creating as much value together with our negotiating adversary and claiming our full share of that value.</p> <h3 id="negotiation-setup-understanding-motives"><a href="#negotiation-setup-understanding-motives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Negotiation Setup: Understanding Motives</h3> <p>If we're able to design a better negotiating process, we can get a better deal. To do this, we have to understand both party's needs</p> <p>Before we negotiate, we need to understand the</p></div> <footer><!----> <hr> <!----></footer></article> <div class="sticker vuepress-toc"><div class="vuepress-toc-item vuepress-toc-h2 active"><a href="#yes-to-impress" title="Yes to Impress">Yes to Impress</a></div><div class="vuepress-toc-item vuepress-toc-h2"><a href="#party-of-no" title="Party of No">Party of No</a></div><div class="vuepress-toc-item vuepress-toc-h2"><a href="#why-do-we-give-away-our-negotiating-power" title="Why Do We Give Away Our Negotiating Power?">Why Do We Give Away Our Negotiating Power?</a></div><div class="vuepress-toc-item vuepress-toc-h2"><a href="#_1-ask-lots-of-questions" title="1.
